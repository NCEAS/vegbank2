# Introduction

This install document describes how to restore the Vegbank database from a data-only dump file. 

# Local Development Installation (Postgres 10.23, MacOS M2)

// TODO: Automate as much of this process as possible with a bash script

Requirements:
- Postgres.app with PostgreSQL 10 â€“ 15 (Universal/Intel)
 - https://postgresapp.com/downloads_legacy.html
- Flyway CLI
 - https://documentation.red-gate.com/fd/command-line-184127404.html

Step 1:

Install the `postgres.app` and launch a Postgres 10.23 server. 

Step 2:

Access the postgres server via `psql`, and create a new vegbank db and roles:

```
CREATE ROLE vegbank WITH LOGIN PASSWORD 'vegbank';
CREATE DATABASE vegbank
WITH
    ENCODING = 'UTF8'
    LC_COLLATE = 'en_US.UTF-8'
    LC_CTYPE = 'en_US.UTF-8';
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE vegbank TO vegbank;
```

Step 3:

Take the `flyway.conf` file and move it into your local flyway `conf` installation. Ensure that the contents match the location of the `/migrations` folder found in the directory where this `vegbank2` repo exists. For example:

```
// ex. /Users/doumok/Code/flyway-10.17.0/conf/flyway.conf
flyway.url=jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/vegbank2
flyway.user=vegbank
flyway.password=vegbank
flyway.locations=filesystem:/Users/doumok/Code/vegbank2/migrations
```

Step 4:

Run the following command to apply migrations up until `V1.11__populate_datadictionary`

```
flyway -target=1.11 migrate
```

Step 5:

Execute the data-only dump file:

```
psql -U doumok -d vegbank2 -f /Users/doumok/Code/testing/vegbank_dataonly_20240814.sql

// The following command will place the output into a txt file of in the directory of your choice
psql -U doumok -d vegbank2 -f /Users/doumok/Code/testing/vegbank_dataonly_20240814.sql > /your/desired/dir/vegbank2_psql_output.txt 2>&1
```

If you don't have a dump file, you can get one by asking a sys admin for `vegbank` to provide you with one via the following command:

```
postgres@vegbank:~/dumps$ pg_dump -d vegbank --data-only -f vegbank_dataonly_[YYMMDD].sq
pg_dump: NOTICE: there are circular foreign-key constraints on this table:
pg_dump:   observation
pg_dump: You might not be able to restore the dump without using --disable-triggers or temporarily dropping the constraints.
pg_dump: Consider using a full dump instead of a --data-only dump to avoid this problem.
pg_dump: NOTICE: there are circular foreign-key constraints on this table:
pg_dump:   party
pg_dump: You might not be able to restore the dump without using --disable-triggers or temporarily dropping the constraints.
pg_dump: Consider using a full dump instead of a --data-only dump to avoid this problem.
pg_dump: NOTICE: there are circular foreign-key constraints on this table:

pg_dump: NOTICE: there are circular foreign-key constraints on this table:

pg_dump: You might not be able to restore the dump without using --disable-triggers or temporarily dropping the constraints.
pg_dump: Consider using a full dump instead of a --data-only dump to avoid this problem.
pg_dump: NOTICE: there are circular foreign-key constraints on this table:
pg_dump:   revision
pg_dump: You might not be able to restore the dump without using --disable-triggers or temporarily dropping the constraints.
pg_dump: Consider using a full dump instead of a --data-only dump to avoid this problem.
pg_dump: NOTICE: there are circular foreign-key constraints on this table:
pg_dump:   soiltaxon
pg_dump: You might not be able to restore the dump without using --disable-triggers or temporarily dropping the constraints.
pg_dump: Consider using a full dump instead of a --data-only dump to avoid this problem.
postgres@vegbank:~/dumps$
```

**NOTE 1:** You can see that the output above generated from creating the dump file displays warnings, no problem. The migration files can handle these issues.

**NOTE 2:** If any exceptions occur with `COPY` commands in the data insertion process, the entire table the command is trying to add into the database will not be executed. Exceptions must be resolved in order for the table's data to be loaded (all or nothing).

Step 6:

Finish the migration:

```
flyway migrate
```

An example of the full process on my local terminal for added context:

```sh
doumok@Dou-NCEAS-MBP14 ~ % psql
psql (14.11 (Homebrew), server 10.23)
Type "help" for help.

doumok=# DROP DATABASE IF EXISTS vegbank2;
DROP DATABASE
doumok=# CREATE ROLE vegbank WITH LOGIN PASSWORD 'vegbank';
doumok=# CREATE DATABASE vegbank2
WITH
    ENCODING = 'UTF8'
    LC_COLLATE = 'en_US.UTF-8'
    LC_CTYPE = 'en_US.UTF-8';
CREATE DATABASE
doumok=# GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE vegbank TO vegbank;
doumok=#
\q
doumok@Dou-NCEAS-MBP14 ~ % flyway -target=1.11 migrate
