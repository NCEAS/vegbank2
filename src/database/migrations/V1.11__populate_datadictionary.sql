List is taken from Cowardin et al. 1979, 1985.  Intermittently flooded  Substrate is usually exposed, but surface water can be present for variable periods without detectable seasonal periodicity. Inundation is not predictable to a given season and is dependent upon highly localized rain storms. This modifier was developed for use in the arid West for water regimes of Playa lakes, intermittent streams, and dry washes but can be used in other parts of the U.S. where appropriate. This modifier can be applied to both wetland and non-wetland situations. Equivalent to Cowardin''s Intermittently Flooded modifier.  Permanently flooded  Water covers the land surface at all times of the year in all years. Equivalent to Cowardin''s "permanently flooded".  Permanently flooded - tidal  Salt water covers the land surface at all times of the year in all years. This modifier applies only to permanently flooded area irregularly flooded by fresh tidal water. Equivalent to Cowardin''s "permanently flooded/tidal".  Saturated  Surface water is seldom present, but substrate is saturated to surface for extended periods during the growing season. Equivalent to Cowardin''s Saturated modifier.  Seasonally flooded  Surface water is present for extended periods during the growing season, but is absent by the end of the growing season in most years. The water table after flooding ceases is very variable, extending from saturated to a water table well below the ground surface. Includes Cowardin''s Seasonal, Seasonal-Saturated, and Seasonal-Well Drained modifiers.  Seasonally saturated    Semipermanently flooded  Surface water persists throughout the growing season in most years. Land surface is normally saturated when water level drops below soil surface. Includes Cowardin''s Intermittently Exposed and Semipermanently Flooded modifiers.  Temporarily flooded  Surface water present for brief periods during growing season, but water table usually lies well below soil surface. Often characterizes flood-plain wetlands. Equivalent to Cowardin''s Temporary modifier.  Tidally flooded  Flooded by the alternate rise and fall of the surface of oceans, seas, and the bays, rivers, etc. connected to them, caused by the attraction of the moon and sun.  Unknown    Upland  Not a wetland.  Very rarely flooded.  Irregularly flooded  Tidal water floods land surface less often than daily; the area must be flooded by tides at least once yearly as a result of extreme high spring tide plus wind plus flow.  Irregularly exposed  Land surface is exposed by tides less often than daily; the area from mean low tide to extreme low spring tide.  Wind-tidally flooded  Flooded by the alternate rise and fall of the surface of oceans, seas, and the bays, rivers, etc. connected to them, caused by the back-up of water caused by unfavorable winds.

Braiding is generally confined to broad, shallow streams of low sinuosity, high bedload, non-cohesive bank material, and step gradient. At a given bank-full discharge, braided streams have steeper slopes and shallower, broader, and less stable channel cross sections than meandering streams.  butte    caldera    canyon  A long, deep, narrow, very steep-sided valley with high and precipitous walls in an area of high local relief.  carolina bay    channel    chenier    chenier plain    cirque  Semicircular, concave, bowl-like area with steep face primarily resulting from erosive activity of a mountain glacier.  cirque floor    cirque headwall    cliff  Any high, very steep to perpendicular or overhanging face of rock or earth; a precipice.  coast    coastal plain    col    collapse sinkhole    colluvial shoulder    colluvial slope    cove    crest  (summit) The commonly linear top of a ridge, hill or mountain.  cuesta    debris slide    delta  A body of alluvium, nearly flat and fan-shaped, deposited at or near the mouth of a river or stream where it enters a body of relatively quiet water, usually a sea or lake.  delta plain    depositional levee    depositional stream terrace    depression    desert pavement    dike    doline    dome  A roughly symmetrical upfold, with bed dipping in all directions, more or less equally, from a point. A smoothly rounded landform or rock mass such as a rock-capped mountain summit, roughly resembling the dome of a building.  drainage    drainage channel (undifferentiated)    draw    drumlin  A low, smooth, elongated oval hill, mound, or ridge of compact glacial till that may or may not have a core of bedrock or stratified glacial drift. The longer axis is parallel to the general direction of glacier flow.  Drumlins are products of streamline (laminar) flow of glaciers, which molded the subglacial floor through a combination of erosion and deposition.  dune (undifferentiated)  A mound, ridge, or hill of loose, windblown granular material (generally sand), either bare or covered with vegetation.  dune field    earth flow    earth hummock    eroded bench    eroding stream channel system    erosional stream terrace    escarpment  (scarp) A relatively continuous and steep slope or cliff breaking the general continuity of more gently sloping land surfaces and produced by erosion or faulting. The term is more often applied to cliffs produced by differential erosion.  esker  A long, narrow sinuous, steep-sided ridge composed of irregularly stratified sand and gravel that was deposited by a subsurface stream flowing between ice walls, or in an ice tunnel of a retreating glacier, and was left behind when the ice melted.  estuary    exogenous dome    fan piedmont    fault scarp    fault terrace    fissure    fissure vent    flat  A general term for a level or nearly level surface or small area of land marked by little or no relief, eg. mud flat or valley flat.  flood plain  (bottomland) The nearly level alluvial plain that borders a stream and is subject to inundation under flood-stage conditions unless protected artificially.  It is usually a constructional landform built of sediment deposited during overflow and lateral migration of the stream.  fluvial    foothills    foredune    frost creep slope    frost mound    frost scar    gap    glaciated uplands    glacier    gorge  (a) A narrow, deep valley with nearly vertical rocky walls, enclosed by mountains, smaller than a canyon, and more steep-sided than a ravine; especially a restricted, steep-walled part of a canyon. (b) A narrow defile or passage between hills or mountains.  graben    ground moraine    gulch    hanging valley    headland    highland    hills  (foothills) A natural elevation of the land surface, rising as much as 300 m above the surrounding lowlands, usually of restricted summit area (relative to a tableland) and having a well-defined outline; hill slopes generally exceed 15%.  The distinction between a hill and a mountain is often dependent on local usage.  hillslope bedrock outcrop    hogback    hoodoo    hummock  A rounded or conical mound of knoll, hillock, or other small elevation.  Also, a slight rise of ground above a level surface.  inlet    inselberg    interdune flat    interfluve    island    kame  A moundlike hill of ice-contact glacial drift, composed chiefly of stratified sand and gravel.  kame moraine    kame terrace    karst    karst tower    karst window    kegel karst    kettle  A steep-sided bowl-shaped depression without surface drainage. It is in glacial drift deposits and believed to have formed by the melting of a large, detached block of stagnant ice buried in the glacial drift.  kettled outwash plain    knob  (a) A rounded eminence, as a knoll, hillock, or small hill or mountain; especially a prominent or isolated hill with steep sides, commonly found in the southern United States. (b) A peak or other projection from the top of a hill or mountain. Also a boulder or group of boulders or an area of resistant rocks protruding from the side of a hill or mountain.  knoll    lagoon    lake    lake bed    lake plain    lake terrace    lateral moraine    lateral scarp (undifferentiated)    lava flow (undifferentiated)    ledge    levee  (floodwall, earth dike) An artificial or natural embankment built along the margin of a watercourse or an arm of the sea, to protect land from inundation or to confine streamflow to its channel.  loess deposit (undifferentiated)    longshore bar    lowland    marine terrace (undifferentiated)    meander belt    meander scar    mesa    mid slope    mima mound    monadnock    moraine (undifferentiated)  A drift topography characterized by chaotic mounds and pits, generally randomly oriented, developed in superglacial drift by collapse and flow as the underlying stagnant ice melted. Slopes may be steep and unstable and there will be used and unused stream coursed and lake depressions interspersed with the morainic ridges. Consequently, there will be rapid or abrupt changes between materials of differing lithology.  mound    mountain valley    mountain(s)  (hill) A natural elevation of the land surface, rising more than 300 m above surrounding lowlands, usually of restricted summit area (relative to a plateau), and generally having steep sides (greater than 25 percent slope) with or without considerable bare-rock surface. A mountain can occur as a single, isolated mass or in a group forming a chain or range. Mountains are primarily formed by deep-seated earth movements and/or volcanic action and secondarily by differential erosion.  mountain-valley fan    mud flat    noseslope    outwash fan    outwash plain  (glacial outwash, kettles) An extensive lowland area of coarse textured, glaciofluvial material. An outwash plain is commonly smooth; where pitted, due to melt-out of incorporated ice masses, it is generally low in relief.  outwash terrace    oxbow  (meander belt, oxbow lake) A closely looping stream meander having an extreme curvature such that only a neck of land is left between the two parts of the stream. A term used in New England for the land enclosed, or partly enclosed, within an oxbow.  patterned ground (undifferentiated)    peat dome    periglacial boulderfield    piedmont    pimple mounds    pingo  A large frost mound; especially a relatively large conical mound of soil-covered ice (commonly 30 to 50 m high and up to 400 m in diameter) raised in part by hydrostatic pressure within and below the permafrost of Arctic regions, and of more than 1 year’s duration.  pinnacle    plain  (lowland, plateau) An extensive lowland area that ranges from level to gently sloping or undulating. A plain has few or no prominent hills or valleys, and usually occurs at low elevation with reference to surrounding areas (local relief generally less than 100m, although some, such as the Great Plains of the United States, are as much as 1000 to 1800 m above sea level.) Where dissected, remnants of a plain can form the local uplands.  plateau  (mesa, plain) An extensive upland mass with a relatively flat summit area that is considerably elevated (more than 100m) above adjacent lowlands, and is separated from them on one or more sides by escarpments. A comparatively large part of a plateau surface is near summit level.  playa    polygon (high-centered)    polygon (low-centered)    pothole    raised beach    raised estuary    raised mudflat    raised tidal flat    ravine  (gulch, draw) A small stream channel; narrow, steep-sided, and commonly V-shaped in cross section; and larger than a gully.  relict coastline    ridge  A long, narrow elevation of the land surface, usually sharp rested with steep sides and forming an extended upland between valleys. The term is used in areas of both hill and mountain relief.  ridge and valley    ridgetop bedrock outcrop    rift valley    rim    riverbed    rock fall avalanche    saddle  A low point on a ridge or crestline, generally a divide (pass, col) between the heads of streams flowing in opposite directions.  sag pond    sandhills    scarp    scarp slope    scour    scoured basin    sea cliff    seep    shoal    shoreline    shoulder  (hill slope) The geomorphic component that form the uppermost inclined surface at the top of a hillslope. It comprises the transition zone from backslope to summit of an upland. The surface is dominantly convex in profile and erosional in origin.  sinkhole (undifferentiated)  (doline) A closed depression formed either by solution of the surficial bedrock (e.g. limestone, gypsum, salt) or by collapse of underlying caves. Complexes of sinkholes in carbonate-rock terraces are the main components of karst topography.  slide    slope    slough    slump and topple prone slope    slump pond    soil creep slope    solution sinkhole    spit  (a) A small point or low tongue or narrow embankment of land, commonly consisting of sand or gravel deposited by longshore drifting and having one end attached to the mainland and the other terminating in open water, usually the sea; a fingerlike extension of the beach. (b) A relatively long, narrow shoal or reef extending from the shore into a body of water.  splay  A small alluvial fan or other outspread deposit formed where an overloaded stream breaks through a levee and deposits its material (often coarse-grained) on the flood plain.  stone circle    stone stripe    stream terrace (undifferentiated)    streambed    subjacent karst collapse sinkhole    subsidence sinkhole    swale  (a) A slight depression, sometimes swampy, in the midst of generally level land. (b) A shallow depression in an undulating ground moraine due to uneven glacial deposition. (c) A long, narrow, generally shallow, trough-like depression between two beach ridges, and aligned roughly parallel to the coastline.  talus    tarn    terrace  A step-like surface, bordering a valley floor or shoreline, that represent the former position of an alluvial plain, or lake or sea shore. The term is usually applied to both the relatively flat summit surface (platform, tread), cut or built by stream or wave action, and the steeper descending slope (scarp, riser), graded to a lower base level of erosion.  tidal flat    tidal gut    till plain    toe slope    toe zone (undifferentiated)    transverse dune    trench    trough    valley  (basin) An elongate, relatively large, externally drained depression of the earth''s surface that is primarily developed by stream erosion.  valley floor    wave-built terrace    wave-cut platform   '

At a given bank-full discharge, braided streams have steeper slopes and shallower, broader, and less stable channel cross sections than meandering streams.',
